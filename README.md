Name of the Project
Personal Expense Tracker with Visualization

Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas (for data storage and manipulation)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Datetime (for date handling and formatting)
OS (to manage file operations)
File Format: CSV (for storing expenses data)
Working Procedure
Initialization:

Checked if the expenses file (expenses.csv) exists. If not, initialized it with the necessary columns: Date, Category, Amount, and Description.
Adding Expenses:

Allowed users to input expense details: date, category, amount, and description.
Validated inputs to ensure proper formats (e.g., date in YYYY-MM-DD, amount as a float).
Appended the new expense to the existing file and saved the updated data.
Viewing Expenses:

Displayed all stored expenses in a tabular format for easy review.
Visualization:

Expenses by Category:
Aggregated total expenses for each category.
Visualized the data using a pie chart, showing percentage contributions of each category.
Expenses Over Time:
Grouped expenses by date and calculated daily totals.
Plotted a time series line graph to display trends in spending over time.
User Interface:

Implemented a simple text-based menu for user interaction with the following options:
Add a new expense.
View all expenses.
Visualize expenses by category.
Visualize expenses over time.
Exit the application.
Provided error handling for invalid inputs and displayed appropriate messages.
Learning Outcomes
Developed skills in file handling and data persistence using CSV files.
Learned how to process and validate user inputs dynamically.
Gained experience in visualizing financial data through pie charts and time series plots.
Enhanced understanding of grouping and aggregating data for meaningful insights.
Practiced designing a user-friendly, text-based application for real-world tasks.
